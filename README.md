# bus-dispatching-in-rolling-horizons

This repository is meant for publishing some of the code related to the **bus dispatching problem in rolling horizons** applied in public transit (in particular, **bus services**).

Currently, this repository contains two model instances:

1. The `Program_Q.py` script introduced in the paper **An exact method for the bus dispatching problem in rolling horizons**, which is currently under scientific review. This script contains all necessary functions to calculate the solution of the mathematical program for the demonstration scenario presented in section 5.1. 

2. The `program_P.py` script contains all necessary functions to calculate the solution of the mathematical program **P** for the demonstration scenario presented in section 5.1. 

# Referencing

In case you use this code for scientific purposes, it is appreciated if you provide a citation to the paper **An exact method for the bus dispatching problem in rolling horizons** once it is publicly available.
